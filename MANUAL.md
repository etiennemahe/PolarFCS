# PolarFCS
Installation instructions can be found in the "README.md" file
## PolarFCS Masthead
Users must select an input file, either by pasting the full file path into the "File Path" text box or by clicking on "Select File for Analysis"

Users should then click on "Analyze" (or "Cancel/Exit" to exit the program fully)

## Input file format
PolarFCS will accept ".txt", ".csv", ".lmd" or ".fcs" files. 

The former two file formats should be uncompressed tab- or comma-demlimited files, respectively, with the first row listing parameter names (as strings). Subsequent rows are assumed to be events; these must be unnamed (i.e. the first column is the first parameter and should not be a column of row names)
